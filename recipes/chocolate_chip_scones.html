        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These delicious chocolate chip scones are perfect for breakfast or as a snack any time.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of unsalted butter, cold</li>
                <li>1 cup of dark chocolate chips</li>
                <li>3/4 cup of buttermilk</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400°F. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. </li>
                <li>Grate the cold butter using a cheese grater. This is an easy way to get it into small pieces to incorporate in the dry ingredients. If you do not have a cheese grater, you can just cut into small cubes. Blend the grated butter in with the flour mixture using a pastry cutter or 2 knives. The mixture should be clumpy and look like course crumbs. Mix in the chocolate chips.</li>
                <li>In a small measuring cup, mix together the buttermilk and vanilla. Mix into the flour mixture until JUST incorporated. DO NOT over mix, this will make the scones too dense. </li>
                <li>Put a small amount of flour onto a clean surface and knead the dough briefly. Shape the dough into a circle that is about 1 ½ inches thick. Cut the circle in half and then each half into 4-5 wedges (depending on how big you want your scones). </li>
                <li>Put the wedges on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Brush the tops with a little bit of milk and then lightly sprinkle with sugar.</li>
                <li>Bake for 20-22 minutes until tops are golden brown and toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
            </ol>
