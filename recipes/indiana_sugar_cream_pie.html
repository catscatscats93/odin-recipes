                <li>1 cup of sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of cornstarch</li>
                <li>2 cups of 2% milk</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of butter, cubed</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 450°. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. Trim crust to 1/2 in. beyond rim of plate; flute edge. Refrigerate 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Line unpricked crust with a double thickness of foil. Fill with pie weights, dried beans or uncooked rice. Bake on a lower oven rack until edge is light golden brown, 15-20 minutes. Remove foil and weights; bake until bottom is golden brown, 3-6 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack. Reduce oven setting to 375°.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, combine sugar and cornstarch; stir in milk until smooth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cook and stir 2 minutes or until thickened and bubbly. Remove from heat; stir in butter and vanilla. Transfer to crust; sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake until golden brown, 15-20 minutes. Cool on a wire rack; refrigerate until chilled.</li>
